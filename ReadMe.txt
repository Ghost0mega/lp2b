Project by group E : Luna Hascoet, Amber Guyenot-Cosio
Repo(in case there is something wrong with the package and has the advantage of passing trough informations that the package cannot) : https://github.com/Ghost0mega/lp2b

The project was made on 16:10 screens so the internal ratio is set to that. Some things might break a little (especially UI) if you open a build on fullscreen with a 16:9 ratio or use a different ratio within the unity editor. Please be mindful of this while you're grading.

you can also temporally change your screen's ratio with windows' settings if you wish to experience the build as we made it.
For Exemple :

1680×1050 (we recommend this one if your screen can handle it)

1440×900

1920×1200

1280×800

Features used that were not showed in class:

Tag detection(usually for collision)
Using layers to sort what collides with what
Making everything as modular as possible in order to make future implementations faster(especially for shooting powerups in the UFO game and sound as well)
Using sound manager instances
Using mathematical functions for easings and such(please notice the bounce of the gave over menu it was hard)
Algorithmic starts in every game using a lot of prefabs and instancing.
Usage of public class variables to avoid hard coding values into prefabs and unnecessary search functions.
Extensive use of public methods and heredity
Systematic implementation of game controllers
